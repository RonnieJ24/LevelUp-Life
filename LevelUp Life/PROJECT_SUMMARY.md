## 🏗️ Architecture

### Design Patterns
- **MVVM**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Singleton Services**: Shared managers (GameEngine, StoreManager, etc.)
- **Combine**: Reactive state management with `@Published`
- **Async/Await**: Modern concurrency for HealthKit and CloudKit

### Data Flow
```
User Action → View → ViewModel → Service → Model → ViewModel → View Update
```

### Key Components

#### Models (7 files)
- `User.swift`: Profile, stats, currencies, settings
- `Quest.swift`: Quest data with types, categories, verification
- `Completion.swift`: Quest completion records with verification payload
- `Reward.swift`: XP, currencies, items, loot chests
- `Item.swift`: Cosmetics, boosters, purchasables
- `Guild.swift`: Social teams and challenges
- `Season.swift`: Seasonal events and passes

#### Services (7 files)
- `GameEngine.swift`: Core game logic (XP, leveling, rewards)
- `TrustEngine.swift`: Verification confidence scoring
- `HealthKitManager.swift`: Health data integration
- `NotificationManager.swift`: Local notifications
- `QuestTemplateService.swift`: Pre-built quest templates
- `StoreManager.swift`: StoreKit 2 IAP
- `CloudKitManager.swift`: iCloud sync

#### Views (11 files)
- `MainTabView.swift`: Tab navigation
- `HomeView.swift`: Daily quests and stats
- `QuestsView.swift`: Quest management
- `ChestView.swift`: Reward chests
- `StoreView.swift`: In-app purchases
- `SocialView.swift`: Guilds and leaderboards
- `ProfileView.swift`: User profile and stats
- `OnboardingView.swift`: First-time user flow
- `FocusTimerView.swift`: Deep work timer
- `QuestTemplatePickerView.swift`: Template selection
- `RewardAnimationView.swift`: Reward reveal overlay

## 🎮 How It Works

### Daily Flow
1. **Morning**: User opens app → sees daily quest scroll (3-5 quests)
2. **During Day**: User completes quests → earns XP, gold, and trust
3. **Evening**: User unlocks daily chest (3+ quests) → collects loot
4. **Streak**: Completing 3+ quests maintains daily streak

### Quest Completion
```
1. User taps "Complete Quest"
2. TrustEngine verifies signals (HealthKit, timer, etc.)
3. GameEngine calculates rewards (XP × trust × streak)
4. User levels up and currencies update
5. Reward animation displays
6. Data saves locally (and syncs to CloudKit)
```

### Verification Logic
```swift
Confidence = Σ(Signal Weights) / Signal Count

If confidence ≥ 0.6:
  → Full rewards
  → +0.5 trust score
Else if confidence ≥ 0.3:
  → Reduced rewards
  → No trust change
Else:
  → Minimal rewards
  → -1.0 trust score
  → Possible spot check
```

### Trust Score Impact
```
Trust 0-40:   0.5× rewards, 40% spot check rate
Trust 40-70:  0.7× rewards, 10% spot check rate
Trust 70-100: 1.0-1.2× rewards, minimal checks
```

## 💡 Key Implementation Highlights

### Smart State Management
```swift
@MainActor
class AppViewModel: ObservableObject {
    static let shared = AppViewModel()
    @Published var currentUser: User?
    @Published var dailyQuests: [Quest] = []
    // Centralized state accessible throughout app
}
```

### Reactive UI Updates
```swift
// Changes to viewModel automatically update all views
viewModel.currentUser?.xp += 50
// XP bar, level, and currencies update instantly
```

### Modular Services
```swift
let xp = GameEngine.shared.calculateXPReward(
    for: quest,
    trustScore: user.trustScore,
    streakMultiplier: 1.5
)
// Clean separation of business logic
```

### Async HealthKit
```swift
let workout = try await HealthKitManager.shared.fetchRecentWorkout()
// Modern concurrency with async/await
```

- Cached calculations (XP curves)
- Debounced state updates
- GPU-accelerated animations

### Memory Management
- Weak references in closures
- Automatic cleanup of timers
- Efficient image loading
- Proper observable cleanup

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

### Data Storage
